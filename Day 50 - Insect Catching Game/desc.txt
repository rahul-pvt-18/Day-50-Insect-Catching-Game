💥 Title: Catch the Insect Game

I'm thrilled to present my Day 50 project, the Catch the Insect Game! 🚀🐛🕷️🦟

The Catch the Insect Game is a fun and interactive web game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players can select their favorite insect from the list, and the game will start. The objective is to catch as many insects as possible within the given time. Players can catch the insects by clicking on them as they appear randomly on the screen. The game includes a timer and a score counter to keep track of the player's progress. 🏆🕰️

The game features a retro-style user interface, giving players a nostalgic gaming experience reminiscent of classic arcade games. Players can challenge themselves to beat their high scores and improve their reflexes as they catch the insects in a fast-paced environment. 🎮🔥

I had a blast working on this project, creating the insect elements, implementing the random positioning, and keeping track of the player's score and time. The game also includes a humorous message that appears when the player reaches a high score, adding a fun element to the gameplay. 😄📈

Feel free to try out the Catch the Insect Game and compete with your friends to see who can catch the most insects in the given time. You can also customize the insect options, add new insects, or experiment with different game mechanics to make the experience even more exciting and challenging. 🕷️🦋🐜
